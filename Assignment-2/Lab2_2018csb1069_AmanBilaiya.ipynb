If we have 100 datapoints (70 Males + 30 Females) to train upon. Then group fairness tries to capture this ratio within each formed cluster. In simple words,it tries to maintain the ratio of males:females in each cluster to be 70:30 ie 7:3 . <br> \n",

This final minimum will be the balance. In dataset you can assume male being denoted by 1 and female being denoted by 0*<br><br>\n",
