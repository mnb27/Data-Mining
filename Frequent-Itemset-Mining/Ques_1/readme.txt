## README DOC FOR QUES 1 - Principal Component Analysis

_________________________________HOW TO RUN CODE___________________________________
- Open "Principal_Component_Analysis.ipynb" file in jupyter notebook
- To run in google collab [Upload Ques_1 folder to GDrive and then mount drive & change working directory to this drive folder]
- Now simply run each cell one by one if you want to test it. [Else cells are already executed and outputs are shown for refernce]

- For info about the Dataset one can run "dataInfo.ipynb" file by following same steps as above

One can change number of PCA Components required and dataset file on the notebook code and run. I have taken 2-Components
for a clear visualization purpose.

NOTE : Ensure that working directory is same as path of "Ques_1 folder"

OUTPUTS :
Shown over jupyter notebook
